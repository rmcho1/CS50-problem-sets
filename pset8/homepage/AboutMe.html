                I grew up with two sisters (I'm the middle child) and lived in the city until I went to college.
                I attended UC Davis where I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in fashion. I moved to Los Angeles
                a few years after graduation to get obtain a degree in fashion design. In 2017, I landed my dream job 
                in NYC and worked tirelessy for runway collections. 
                
                During my free time, I like hunting for the best noodle spots and cute towns to visit.
                I also like keeping up with current news in technology and fashion.
